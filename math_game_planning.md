Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems.
A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.
The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Both players start with 3 lives.
player loses a life if question is answered wrong.
At end of every turn, game should output new scores for both players.
Game doesn’t end until one player loses all their lives.
At this point, game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.

ex output:  
Player 1: What does 5 plus 3 equal?  
9  
Player 1: Seriously? No!  
P1: 2/3 vs P2: 3/3  
----- NEW TURN -----  
Player 2: What does 2 plus 6 equal?  
8  
Player 2: YES! You are correct.  
P1: 2/3 vs P2: 3/3  
----- NEW TURN -----  
... some time later ...  
Player 1 wins with a score of 1/3  
----- GAME OVER -----  
Good bye!
